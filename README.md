# UDP Robust Design

Lab 6 of Intro to Network programming

The client and server programs aims to send files over UDP with a reliable approach.

## Protocol Design
### client (sender)
```
seq: sequence generated by server or client
cksum: checksum of only payload
offset: number of characters from the beginning of the file to the beginning of payload
len: length of only payload
filename:
fileEnd: set to 1 when the packet is the end of one file
(payload)
```
### server(receiver)

## Strategy
- cumulative ACK
- If a gap is detected
    - reACK the sequence number of last received packet
    - discard newly received packets (sliding window: Go Back N)
